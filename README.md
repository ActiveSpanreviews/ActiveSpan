Your body should work like clockwork when youâ€™re healthy, making sleep ideal for relaxing and unwinding after a long day at work or school. Typically, youâ€™ll fall asleep easily when youâ€™re tired and only wake up after you have had enough sleep.[Official Website](https://snoppymart.com/shop-activespan)  
  
These processes should occur, as mentioned above, without causing any issues. But as the world is not perfect, every once in a while, your body may experience difficulties falling asleep. This often indicates that something is wrong with it, hence the need to exercise caution.  
  
**[Below, we are going to look into what causes sleeping issues and the best way to address them.](https://snoppymart.com/shop-activespan)**

What Causes Insomnia?
---------------------

Many reasons are to blame for insomnia and other sleeping issues. One common reason is the interruption of your daily routine. For example, if youâ€™re accustomed to sleeping and waking up at the same time, the body will slowly become used to this routine.  
  
On the same note, you should understand that staying up later than usual and failing to compensate for this in the morning can lead to irritability, general weakness, and chronic fatigue. Eventually, all this will add up and make it hard for you to fall asleep at night.

FAQ's

**How does ActiveSpan work to support normal circadian rhythm?**  
  
ActiveSpan works based on the findings of modern science, which have proven that gut microbiota deficit is to blame for insomnia. This deficit occurs due to diet imbalances, which destabilize serotonin levels, making it hard for the brain to relax and allow you to fall asleep.  
  
The ingredients used in making ActiveSpan assist in protecting your gut microbiota, ensuring serotonin production doesnâ€™t get affected in any way. Its other benefits include enhancing the immune system and providing the body with essential minerals and amino acids.
